## Description

Are you a self-proclaimed vino? Then, you might like playing around with this data set that measures different wine characteristics by chemical properties and also includes a measurement of quality. Can you sniff out which types of wines are likely to be of the best quality? Perfect for the learning or experienced wine aficionado (enthusiast).

The two datasets are related to red and white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.

## Attributes
