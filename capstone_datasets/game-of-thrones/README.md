# Game of Thrones - Who will Die and Who will Live?

## Description

The TV (and Book) Series of “A Song of Ice and Fire” or “Game of Thrones” took the world by storm and is still considered one of the most watched shows of all time. One of the popular themes in this series was the frequent (and unexpected) deaths of beloved characters. Using this data, can we create a prediction model of who lives and who dies?
You may be surprised by the results!

"Of course, it goes without saying that this dataset contains spoilers ;)

This dataset combines three sources of data, all of which are based on information from the book series.

Firstly, there is battles.csv which contains Chris Albon's "The
War of the Five Kings" Dataset. Its a
great collection of all of the battles in the series.

Secondly we have `character-deaths.csv` from Erin Pierce and Ben
Kahle. This dataset was created as a part of their Bayesian Survival
Analysis.

Finally we have a more comprehensive character dataset with
`character-predictions.csv`. It
includes their predictions on which character will die."
